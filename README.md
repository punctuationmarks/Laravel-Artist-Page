Wanted to see what was happening in PHP's web development with Laravel so I built this simple artist gallery page. 

Straight forward site for an artist to show current and up-to-date photos
and commnetary on their work. CRUD app with photo features with passwordless sign in
for ease of use and to avoid security issues. 


_Development was focused on Firefox, so might not render properly through Heroku otherwise_
- Testing site [here](http://jack-georgopolus.herokuapp.com/)  deployed on Heroku
